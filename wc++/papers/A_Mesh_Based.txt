Abstract
Wireless networks in home, office and sensor applications consist of nodes with low mobility. Most of these networks
have at least a few powerful machines additionally connected by a wireline network. Topology information of the
wireless network at these powerful nodes can be used to control transmission power, avoid congestion, compute routing
tables, discover resources, and to gather data. In this paper we propose an algorithm for topology discovery in wireless
networks with slow moving nodes and present various performance characteristics of this algorithm. The proposed
algorithm discovers all links and nodes in a stable wireless network and has an excellent message complexity: the
algorithm has an optimal message complexity in a stable network and the overhead degrades slowly with increasing
mobility of the nodes.
Keywords: topology discovery, wireless networks, distributed systems, home networks, sensor networks.

1. Introduction
Wireless networks are becoming increasingly popular. In particular, wireless local area networks are gaining popularity in both office and home settings. Wireless networks are favored over wireline networks for many reasons.
For example, they are easier to install in existing buildings and they also give the users complete mobility. As a
consequence we expect that in the future, they will be even more widespread.

One approach to wireless communication is via the use of base stations. In this approach all nodes in the network
communicate directly with the base station, which redirects the traffic to the destination node. However, there are
several disadvantages to this approach. For example, in certain applications there might be no such preexisting infrastructure available. Also, in many other applications, e.g., home and office or sensor applications, the devices might be
battery operated, and the limited power consumption therefore prevents long range communication.
Ad hoc networking, on the other hand, avoids the disadvantages mentioned above by allowing all nodes to communicate directly which each other. Unfortunately, this approach requires partial information of the network to be stored
at the wireless nodes, which might not be powerful enough to handle this. In our work we therefore take advantage of
the fact that in most wireless networks there is at least one node which is powerful enough to store information when
required. We call this kind of network a hybrid wireless network and describe it in detail in Section 2.
Many of the applications for these networks rely on the underlying topology information. For example, management of a sensor network or a relief operation requires the knowledge of connectivity of the nodes. The monitoring
entity needs to learn of any areas in the network that are too dense or too sparse, or of altogether disconnected nodes.
This knowledge can help the monitor make better use of resources in the system. Other applications for topology
discovery are power management, routing in ad hoc networks, network visualization, and resource discovery, just to
name a few.
In this paper we propose and evaluate a topology discovery protocol. Our design decisions were guided by our

  time in a “stable” network

(see Section 2.3 for a definition of stable) with  wireless nodes, and worst case in    when the network is no
target domain: wireless home and office networks. The proposed protocol runs in

longer stable, e.g., due to mobility. The term

denotes the average degree of a node. As a part of our protocol we

also present a method for building a mesh spanning the network. This mesh can be used in any application to gather
data located across the network and is not limited to topology discovery.
In what follows, we first describe our system and failure model in Section 2. In Section 3, we then formally define
the topology discovery problem that we solve in this paper. Section 4 goes on to describing the proposed topology
discovery protocol, and in Section 5 we discuss some properties of the protocol. Section 6 describes our performance
measurements, and in Section 7 we describe the related work. We conclude in Section 8. A list of symbols can be
found in Table 3 (at the end of the paper).

2. System Architecture and Model
We believe that future home and small office networks will have the following characteristics. The network will
most likely consist of a wireline and a wireless network. The wireline network will at least be needed to connect to a
broadband modem (e.g., a cable or DSL modem). In some homes the wireline network might be restricted to connect
the broadband modem to a home server which in turn provides services to wireless nodes. These services would most
likely include wireless base station functionality, routing, and DHCP service. In new homes the wireline network will
most likely connect more devices. It would make sense to connect at least all desktops to the wireline network. Some
desktops might have additional access to the wireless network and provide services to the other wireless nodes. Mobile
devices, such as laptops and PDAs, will use the wireless network to communicate with each other and the Internet.

limited. The average speed of a moving node is expected to be limited by walking speed, which is about 1 m/s.

Figure 1. A system consists of wireline nodes ( ), mobile nodes (

!=; ), and gateway nodes (-; ).

Mobile and gateway nodes are called wireless nodes.

2.1. Communication System
Wireless transmissions have much higher bit error rates than wireline transmissions. Current transport protocols, in
particular, TCP/IP, are designed for wireline networks. They do not perform well if the frequency of dropped packets
is too high. Hence, wireless technologies like 802.11 use MAC layer acknowledgements to detect and retransmit
dropped packets. This permits a sender to detect if the transmission of a message has failed.
The gateway nodes provide routing functionality for all wireless nodes. A gateway node might operate as a wireless
base station or it might be a member of a wireless ad hoc network. In either case, it provides routing capability for
other wireless nodes in its neighborhood. Logically, the topology discovery protocol has to be independent from the
network layer (i.e., routing layer) since the routing tables might be computed using the topology provided by the
topology discovery protocol. Hence, a node is restricted by only being able to send messages to its neighbors, i.e.,
messages sent by the protocol are not routed.
We abstract away the details of the MAC and network layer and assume the following communication model. Each

late, then

respect to real-time.
Current MAC layers do not provide a robust local broadcast mechanism. Nevertheless, we assume (and show in
Section 4.2.3 how to implement) such a mechanism. Any practical implementation will use unreliable broadcasts
provided by the MAC layer to implement such a robust broadcast mechanism. We assume that all neighbors of the

then

This is a valid assumption because underlying wireless protocols, e.g., the 802.11 MAC layer,

require links to be bidirectional too.

2.2. Failure Model
A node can schedule certain tasks to be executed at a certain point in time. Typically, such a task sends one or
more messages. To simplify our model, we assume that a node does not suffer performance failures: a non-crashed
node will execute all its tasks at their scheduled times and that the processing times are negligible. Practically, this is
just an accounting trick and does not mean that we have a synchronous system model. We achieve this by adding the
scheduling and processing delays to the transmission delay of the messages (see Figure 2).
A node has crash failure semantics, i.e., a node can only fail by prematurely stopping the execution of its program.

is symmetric in the sense that if WZ;CX T is stable in Y , then W T X ; is also stable in Y . By requiring that at least one message
We denote the link from wireless nodes

is sent via a stable link, we ensure that a broken link cannot be called stable during periods in which no messages are
exchanged. Formally, we can express predicate

We say that a link W ;X T is disconnected in an interval Y if 1), there exists at least one message that is sent between 5 ;
and 5DT in Y and 2), no message sent between 5 ; and 5JT in Y is delivered. We define predicate A  ?G¡¢ :: @¡F\@ A as

A disconnected link is never stable and vice versa. However, a link might neither be stable nor disconnected. We call
such a link unstable:

wireline network. We assume instead that a wireless node

(coordinator) initiates the protocol.

in form of a predicate I . Predicate IdÂfÃª holds iff the protocol discovered the link WZ;CX T , i.e., that 5 T can receive

We define the topology discovery problem as follows. The discovery is initiated by node

We have to specify that the topology returned by a correct topology discovery protocol reflects the topology of the
wireless network. Note that the topology might change due to mobility during the run-time of the protocol and hence,
we cannot require that the topology

is identical to the topology of the wireless network. Instead we constrain

follows. First, if the protocol says that a link

This specification implies that if the network is stable, the topology returned to consists of all stable links. It also

guarantees that in a semi-stable network, the topology returned by the protocol includes all nodes and it contains all
stable links but it might also contain unstable links. However, it will never contain disconnected links.
Note that for a link

Y

to be stable in , at least one of the neighboring nodes

5; or 5 T

has to send a message to

the other. Because of this requirement, a trivial protocol could send no message, and thus ensure that no link is stable.
This trivial protocol could therefore immediately return with an empty topology, and still satisfy our specification. To
prevent such trivial solutions, we note that other protocols are allowed to send messages in parallel to the messages
to the topology discovery protocol. More precisely, the protocol designer has to consider an adversary that can send
messages at arbitrary times between arbitrary nodes during the protocol execution. In this way, we exclude trivial
solutions and force a correct protocol to send messages to discover the topology of the network.

4. Protocol Description
The topology discovery algorithm consists of two phases. The first phase, which we refer to as the Diffusion phase,
is initiated by the coordinator by broadcasting a topology request message. As the nodes receive and rebroadcast
this message, they construct their local neighborhood information, and update other data structures used to construct
a mesh which at the end of the Diffusion phase spans the complete network. This mesh is then used in the second
phase, the Gathering phase, to forward the local neighborhood information from all the nodes up to the coordinator.
Together, these two phases provide the coordinator with the required topology information.
Before we describe the protocol in detail, we give a brief overview illustrated by some examples. The coordinator
initiates the protocol by broadcasting a topology request message. The first time a node receives such a message, it
records its sender as a parent, records this information in the message, and retransmits it using a robust local broadcast.
To increase the reliability of the algorithm, each node also records the senders of the next

aÙ * +

requests it receives

as its parents (unless the request was broadcasted by a potential descendant), and rebroadcasts them. The constant

O
is bounded by a small integer

Ù

, and is determined by the coordinator. Each node records its children by checking

if it is listed as a parent of the sender in each received request message. In this manner, all nodes reachable by the
coordinator will at the end of the Diffusion phase have anywhere from 1 to

Ù

parents, together forming a mesh (see

Figure 3).
In the Gathering phase, each node sends its and its descendants’ neighborhood information to all its parents via
unicast messages. These unicasts are initiated either as soon as it has received the neighborhood information from
all its children, or when it has waited a pre-determined amount of time inversely proportional to its distance to the
coordinator, whichever occurs first. In a failure free run, the coordinator receives the desired topology information
after a total of



messages (see Figure 4). We describe the Gathering phase in more detail and under less ideal

conditions in Section 4.3.
In the rest of this section, we first present the message formats together with the data structures stored at each node
in Section 4.1. This is followed by a formal description of the Diffusion phase of the algorithm in Section 4.2, and the
section is concluded in Section 4.3 with a description of the Gathering phase.

4.1. Message Formats and Data Structures
In this section, we present the formats of the messages used in the protocol, as well as the data structures maintained
locally at each node in the network. This section is meant to be used as a reference section for Sections 4.2 and 4.3,
where the details of how these messages and data structures are used and updated are described.
The protocol uses three message types: DiffReq, DiffAck and GathResp. DiffReq is the topology request
message initiated by the coordinator, and later rebroadcasted by the other nodes, DiffAck is a special acknowledgement sent as part of the reliable broadcast described in Section 4.2.3, and GathResp is the message used to propagate
the topology information up to the coordinator during the second phase of the protocol. The fields of the three messages are described in Table 1, the data structures maintained locally at each node are presented in Table 2. The details
of how these data structures are used and updated will be described in Section 4.2 and 4.3.

We use an adjacency list to represent the information in the topoInfo field of the GathResp message, and the

4.2. Diffusion Phase
The Diffusion phase is the first phase of the topology discovery protocol. The coordinator initiates it by broadcasting
a DiffReq message. When a node receives such a message, it rebroadcasts it (at most

Ù×Þ+

times). The Diffusion

phase has two purposes. First, it updates the local neighborhood information of the nodes. A node
by the coordinator will receive a message from all its neighbors and vice versa. Hence,

5 ;

5;

that is reachable

will add all its neighbors to

its neighbor list (L). The second purpose of the Diffusion phase is to build a coordinator rooted mesh spanning across
the entire network. If the network is partitioned the mesh might not contain all nodes. However, in a semi-stable
network it contains all nodes reachable from the coordinator. This mesh is used by the Gathering phase to propagate
the accumulated neighborhood information up to the coordinator.
It is important to note that the mesh can be used for any kind of data gathering application, and it is not in anyway
dependent on the topology discovery application. It can also be used in applications such as determining the power
usage, or any kind of data aggregation in a sensor network. We therefore start by describing how to construct this
mesh. In Section 4.2.2 we then show the remaining steps of the Diffusion phase, and finally, in Section 4.2.3 we show
how we have implemented the broadcasts, to increase their robustness.

If the node has less than k nodes in its Parent list, and the field sender is not in the Parent list, and this
DiffReq has a hopCount field smaller than or equal to HopCount th, then the node
– adds the sender of the message to its Parent list,
– increments the hopCount field of the message by one,
– copies the sender field into the parent field,
– sets itself as the sender, and
– rebroadcasts the message.

à

If the node is in the parent field of the DiffReq, then it
– adds the sender to its Children list.

4.2.2 Updating Neighborhood Information
To update the local neighborhood information we add the following to the algorithm described in Section 4.2.1.

à

The node always adds the sender of any message to its neighbor list L.

At the completion of the Diffusion phase the complete connectivity information of the network can be constructed
from the local neighborhood information available at all the nodes. During the Gathering phase we collect this info
and propagate it up to the coordinator through the mesh built during the Diffusion phase.
A node will only add links to its neighbor list across which it has received at least one message during the execution
of the protocol. This means that only links that satisfy requirement R1 are added. Note that the DiffReq message
will be received by each node

that is connected to the coordinator via a path of stable links. In particular,

rebroadcast the DiffReq message and add all nodes connected to
in Section 4.3 that the neighbor lists of

will be forwarded to the coordinator – which is needed and sufficient to

satisfy requirement R2.
4.2.3 Robust Broadcast
The success of the Diffusion phase depends on the reliability of the broadcasts: if many broadcasts fail, fewer links
are discovered. Broadcasts in most MACs for ad hoc networks are not reliable. In 802.11 for example, broadcasts are
sent whenever the carrier is sensed free and can therefore result in a number of collisions as shown in Figure 6. In this
example we have simulated the Diffusion phase using GloMoSim [15] with three different transmission powers. We
see that as we increase the transmission power and therefore the neighbor density, more broadcast messages collide
and a smaller fraction of the links are discovered.

Figure 6. Simulation results for three different transmission powers. These GloMoSim simulations used 50 nodes in a 200mx200m area.

We increase the robustness of broadcasts by using a variation of the RTS/CTS scheme proposed by [14]. The idea
is to ensure that the broadcast reaches at least one node in the neighborhood. To use this scheme, we could let each
node do a RTS/CTS with the node from which it received a request whenever it wishes to rebroadcast it.
An RTS/CTS mechanism is however mostly helpful for large messages. In the Diffusion phase the DiffReq messages that are being broadcast are small in size, and the lengthy message exchange of an RTS, followed by a CTS, the
DiffReq message, and finally an acknowledgement is unnecessary. Instead, a node simply broadcasts the DiffReq
and expects a DiffAck in response from the node from which it received the request it is now retransmitting. If a
node does not receives a DiffAck within a certain amount of time, it rebroadcasts the message. This is repeated
a small number of times, or until it receives a DiffAck, which ever occurs first. Our simulations show that this
scheme adds a lot of robustness to the Diffusion phase. For example, in the scenarios simulated in Figure 6, the
DiffReq/DiffAck scheme discovers 100% of the links.

4.3. Gathering Phase
In this section we describe the Gathering phase, the second of the two phases of our topology discovery protocol.

Ù

In the Gathering phase the -resilient mesh built in the first phase is used to send the topology information back to the
coordinator. The Gathering phase is initiated by the leaves in the mesh, who send their local neighborhood information
to their parents in a GathResp message. Intermediate nodes wait for replies from all the children before they in their
turn forward a GathResp message to their parents. If no failures occur, the information from all nodes reaches the
coordinator who at this point learns the entire topology information.
In the rest of this section, we describe the Gathering phase in detail. We first describe it for a stable network,
followed by a discussion in Section 4.3.2 on how a few unstable links are handled. In Section 4.3.3 we then describe
how the algorithm is designed to cope with a large number of unstable links.
4.3.1 Stable Network
The mesh structure built in the Diffusion phase defines a dependency between GathResp messages: a node waits
for a response from all its children before initiating a response itself. If a node has no children, i.e., if it has not

12

received any DiffReq messages after a certain amount of time with itself listed as a parent of the sender, it initiates
the Gathering phase. Each leaf

Å²º5 ; Â®Ú^`É

5 ;

in the mesh uses a unicast to send a GathResp to each of its parents, with set

5 ;.

as the topoInfo field, where L is the list of neighbors discovered by

When receiving a GathResp message, a node

5JT

combines its dL data structure with the topoInfo field: dL is

set to the union of dL and topoInfo and then all pairs containing neighborhood information for the same node are
combined. When a node has received a GathResp from all its children, the node builds its own response message
and unicasts it to all its parents, with the combination of

Åªa5 T Â®Ú^É

and dL as the topoInfo field of the message.

In a stable network, the topoInfo field in a GathResp message contains the complete neighborhood information
for all downstream nodes. The coordinator therefore has access to the complete topology information upon receipt
of the GathResp message from the last of its children. The coordinator has thus discovered all the links and nodes
reachable at the end of the Gathering phase.
4.3.2 A Few Unstable Links
The protocol described above works as long as the mesh structure consists of stable links. An unstable link can cause a
parent to wait for a GathResp message from its child, although the child might never be able to send it successfully.

+

This problem is more serious in meshes with a lower resiliency factor. In a -resilient mesh one unstable link can
prevent the downstream information to reach the coordinator. However, a mesh with a resiliency factor greater than
one will be able to tolerate some unstable links if alternate paths exist from the nodes to the coordinator. The scheme
to make a mesh tolerate unstable links is described in the rest of this section.
A parent should not wait for an unbounded amount of time for the reply of a child since a reply might never be
received, e.g., due to a link that failed or due to the crash of a downstream node. The parent should instead timeout after a bounded amount of time to make sure that it forwards its own neighborhood information and that of its
other children that it has received so far. The time-out has to be chosen carefully. If the time-out is too short, some
topology information might never be forwarded to the coordinator since any information that arrives after the time-out
is ignored. 1 If the time-out is too long, the topology information might become stale. Due to mobility some discovered
links might for example become disconnected and some new links might appear before the information is forwarded
to the coordinator.

4.3.3 Many Unstable Links
The protocol described so far gathers all link information as long each node has at least one stable link to a parent
during the Gathering phase. Since the response is sent without much delay and the nodes in a home or office network
are not expected to move at high speeds, the mesh will usually stay stable enough for the Gathering phase to succeed.
In these common scenarios our protocol has an optimal



message complexity and is able to discover all the nodes

and links in the network. However, in a rare situation a node in the mesh might displace itself fast enough to become
disconnected from all its parents such that none of the parents are reachable during the Gathering phase. The support
provided by our protocol for these uncommon scenarios is detailed in the rest of this section.
A node first tries to send the GathResp message to all its parents in the mesh. If none of the parents are reachable,
then it enters a panic mode. In panic mode the node sends the response message to all its other neighbors. This set of
neighbors is determined during the Diffusion phase as described in Section 4.2.2.
A GathResp message from a parent in panic mode causes the parent to be removed from the Parents data

5DT . If 5 ; enters panic mode, then node 5DT should not

any further. So, 5 T removes 5; from its Parents list and enters a panic mode if this list becomes empty.
structure. For example, suppose node

5 ;

is the parent of node

On receiving a GathResp message, the node updates its dL variable with the topoInfo field of the message,
and then does either of the following:

à

If the node has not yet sent its GathResp to all the nodes in its Parents list, then it
– sends the response as described in Section 4.3.2.

à

otherwise if the received message has added new link information to dL, then it
– resends a GathResp message with the new link information to all the nodes in Parents.2 If the Parents list is empty, it enters the panic mode.

à

otherwise it
– ignores the GathResp message.

A worse situation could arise when a node is unable to send its GathResp message to any of its neighbors.
Although a node in this case does not have any of its original neighbors discovered during the Diffusion phase, it
might still get its message across if it broadcasts it. We use a robust broadcast slightly different from the one described
in Section 4.2.3; since the GathResp messages are big, explicit RTS and CTS messages are used. The RTS/CTS is
done with the last neighbor from whom any message was heard or received. To reduce the size of this broadcast we

that in panic mode, as opposed to in non-panic mode, a GathResp message arriving after an expired time-out is not ignored.

14

do not send the complete neighborhood information, but rather only the node information. The argument is that if all
the neighbors of a node have failed, then its link information is not of any use to the coordinator.

5. Protocol Properties
In this section we discuss some qualitative properties of our protocol. First we explain how our protocol satisfies
the requirements R1 and R2 introduced in Section 3. Then we analyze the message complexity of the protocol. Due
to space constrains we omit proofs of the properties. The quantitative performance is presented in Section 6.

5.1. Correctness
The protocol collects link information locally in a neighbor list and then collates and forwards the neighbor lists to
the coordinator during the Gathering phase. The topology information consists of these collated neighbor lists. Only
if a node

5DT

receives a message from

with the same protocol identifier, it adds

to its neighbor list. Adding

is necessary for the protocol to set

stale messages will be used – in particular, only senders of messages that were sent after the protocol was started are
included in the neighbor list. Hence, our protocol satisfies property R1.
Property R2 is only guaranteed if the panic mode is switched on. However, if the network is stable, the protocol
satisfies R2 even if the panic mode is switched off. If the network is stable, a link is either stable or disconnected and
all nodes are reachable by the coordinator. Hence, to violate requirement R2, there has to exist a stable link

WË;X T

that

çICÂºÃª ). Since all nodes are reachable, nodes 5; and 5 T will both send
out broadcast messages during the Diffusion phase. Since WË;X T is assumed to be stable, 5 T will receive the broadcast
of 5 ; and hence, 5DT will include 5 ; in its neighbor list. All links between a parent and a child are stable since
is not part of the topology information (i.e.,

each child was able to receive the message of its parent (and the network is assumed to be stable). This implies that
the neighbor information of

5DT

will propagate to the coordinator. Therefore,

IÂºÃª

has to be part of the topology

information. Note that in a stable network the discovered topology contains all nodes and all stable links.
If the panic mode is turned on, property R2 is satisfied, independent of whether the network is stable. The inverse

topology. If a link WZ;CX T is stable and 5 T is reachable, then 5 T will receive a message from 5; and add 5; to its
neighbor list. Panic mode guarantees that each node 5 T can send its neighbor information to the coordinator as long
of R2 states that if

as it is reachable by the coordinator. Hence, the panic mode guarantees that R2 is always satisfied. Note that in a
semi-stable network, the topology returned by the protocol includes all nodes and it contains all stable links but it
might also contain unstable links. However, it will never contain disconnected links.

message with respect to bandwidth and transmission power usage. Hence, we count a robust broadcast message as one

The message complexity of the Gathering phase is also



as long as the mesh is semi-stable. We say that a

mesh constructed by the Diffusion phase is semi-stable, iff each node is reachable from the coordinator via a path of
stable links along the mesh. When the network is stable, the mesh is semi-stable. Note however, that if the network is
semi-stable, then the mesh is not necessarily semi-stable. This definition of semi-stable mesh implies that each node
has a stable link to at least one of its parents. This prevents the nodes to enter panic mode. Therefore, each node sends
at most one unicast message to each of its parents during the Gathering phase. The message complexity is therefore

for the Gathering phase as long as the mesh is semi-stable.

When the mesh is not semi-stable, some nodes might enter panic mode. If a node in panic mode receives a neighbor
list it has not received previously, it first unicasts a GathResp message to all its neighbors. Assuming that a node
has on average

neighbors, the average number of unicast messages in panic mode is at most

the unicasts messages the node sent failed, it broadcasts a condensed message (see Section 4.3.3). The number of

6. Performance
The topology discovery algorithm was simulated in GloMoSim [15], which uses a parallel, event-driven simulation

è

language called Parsec [3]. 50 nodes were randomly placed in a 200m 200m area. IEEE 802.11 was used as the
MAC protocol and the bandwidth was assumed to be 2 Mbps. The Random Waypoint model was used to model the
mobility of the nodes in the network. In this model each node moves towards a random destination at a speed chosen
randomly between a predefined minimum and maximum value. It then pauses for some duration and continues with
this mobility pattern. In our simulations the minimum speed was set to 0 m/s and the pause time to 30 seconds. We
expect the speed of nodes in our target application to be walking speed, i.e., approximately 1 m/s.
All nodes were set to have the same transmission power, although simulations were carried out for three different
transmission powers: -10 dBm, -6 dBm and -4 dBm. At a transmission power of -10 dBm the average neighborhood
size was about 4, at -6 dBm it was close to 11, and about 17 at -4 dBm. When the transmission power was -4 and -6
dBm, the network was semi-stable for all simulated speeds. At -10 dBm however, the network was only semi-stable
up to 0.8 m/s.
One node was designated as the coordinator and the percentage of links and nodes discovered at this node is
presented in this section. The topology discovery protocol was executed for 12.5 seconds. Link and node information

16

obtained at the coordinator after this interval were not considered.
We evaluate our protocol using three different metrics. First, we measure the percentage of stable links discovered
(See Section 2.3 for a definition of a stable link). It is unreasonable to expect that an algorithm would discover links
that only existed for a short amount of time during the execution of the algorithm. Furthermore, information about
links that do no longer exist is irrelevant, and could also lead to inaccurate information at the coordinator. We therefore
compare the number of links that our protocol discovers, to the actual number of stable links, and use this fraction to
evaluate our protocol.
Second, we measure the percentage of nodes discovered. In some applications the link information might not be of
interest; it is simply enough to learn of the different nodes in the network. We therefore also present the percentage of
nodes discovered as a way of evaluating our protocol.
Third, we measure the message overhead of the protocol. The protocol was executed with and without the panic
mode and for different values of the resiliency factor of the mesh that is formed during the Diffusion phase. A higher
resiliency factor increases the robustness of the protocol but at the expense of an increase in the message overhead.
The panic mode further improves the robustness of our protocol but also results in an added increase in the number

of messages sent during the Gathering phase. During the Diffusion phase, every node sends a constant number of
messages, resulting in



messages, where



is the number of nodes, and

is the constant upper

bound of the resiliency factor of the mesh constructed during the Diffusion phase. We therefore only present the
message overhead incurred during the Gathering phase.
In the rest of this section, we present the results for these three different metrics for the three transmission powers
of -10, -6, and -4 dBm.

Ù

The percentage of stable links discovered using a transmission power of -10 dBm is shown in Figure 7. Without

17

the panic mode the algorithm discovers nearly all the stable links up to 0.4 m/s. An increase in speed reduces the
robustness of the mesh and results in a lower percentage of stable links discovered. The reason for the relatively large
decrease in the number of stable links discovered is that when the coordinator learns of a link from a node
another node

5DT , it cannot infer that there is a link from 5DT to 5 ;

5 ;

to

since we do not assume all links to be bidirectional.

Had we done that, the number of stable links discovered would have increased, both with and without the panic mode.
It is interesting to note that increasing the resiliency factor, i.e., the maximum number of parents allowed is useful
only up to a certain speed: in this case up to 0.6 m/s. When increasing the average number of parents, the average
number of children per node grows, and thus also the probability that at least one link between a parent and a child
breaks. Especially for higher speeds where link breakages are even more common, an increase in the number of
parents thus results in a greater number of nodes that timeout before sending their GathResp messages. Due to these
time-outs, the propagation of neighborhood information to the coordinator is delayed proportionally to the number
of parents. But in a network with sparsely connected nodes moving at a high speed, it is important to forward the
information as fast as possible, since a link might disappear before it is used. In a sparsely connected network with
high speed, the coordinator might therefore discover a higher percentage of stable links if the nodes are permitted
fewer parents, i.e., if the resiliency factor is smaller.
We call this tradeoff between minimizing response time and maximizing mesh resiliency the inversion problem.
The problem of inversion suggests that the resiliency factor should be a tunable parameter, chosen according to the
mobility and density of the network.
With panic mode turned off, the protocol discovers all the stable links as long as the network is stable. With panic
mode turned on, the protocol discovers all the stable links as long as the network is semi-stable. At higher speeds
the network is no longer connected using stable links. The coordinator is therefore unable to receive all the response
messages and this results in a decrease in the percentage of stable links that are discovered. We can also see the effect
of the inversion problem in this case. When the nodes are allowed fewer parents, the GathResp messages are sent
sooner and the coordinator is therefore able to gather information over more links before they break, resulting in a
higher percentage of stable links discovered.
The message overhead of the Gathering phase is shown in Figure 8. When the panic mode is turned off, the
GathResp messages are only sent along the mesh. No effort is made to repair the mesh and so the number of
response messages stays nearly constant across different speeds. The slight variations in each of the curves are due to
the differing structure of the mesh at different speeds. As the resiliency factor increases, the average number of parents
increases and more links are part of the mesh which results in a higher message overhead.
When the panic mode is turned on, the number of replies sent during the Gathering phase increases more with
speed if a larger resiliency factor is used. The reason for this is the inversion problem; when a node has only a few
parents its time-out is shorter and it therefore has a higher probability that the links to its parents still exist. This has
the effect that a network using a larger resiliency factor enters the panic mode for lower speeds than networks with a

does not occur until 1.2 and 1 m/s, respectively. The number of replies drop for higher

speeds since the network is no longer semi-stable. More links are thus broken and fewer nodes enter the panic mode
by receiving GathResp messages sent by other nodes in panic mode.

of the resiliency factor .

Ù

Figure 9 shows the percentage of nodes discovered by the protocol. Without the panic mode, the percentage of
nodes discovered decreases with an increase in speed. This is because the nodes are no longer connected using stable
links along the mesh. We can also see that the inversion problem causes better performance for a smaller value of the
resiliency factor at speeds greater than 0.6 m/s. Again, the shorter time-out results in more information reaching the
coordinator.
When the panic mode is turned on, the percentage of nodes discovered is significantly higher than the percentage
of stable links discovered. This is due to the fact that only one link to or from the node has to be discovered for the
coordinator to learn about the existence of the node.
Note that in Figure 7, 8, and 9 the protocol has a similar performance for

Ùë'ïì

and

Ùë'ðí .

This is because

the nodes only have around four neighbors, and they can therefore not have more than four parents even though five
parents are permitted by the protocol.

Figure 10. Percentage of stable links discovered for -6 dBm transmission power, and different
values of the resiliency factor .

Ù

The percentage of stable links discovered at a transmission power of -6 dBm is shown in Figure 10. Because of a
stronger transmission power, the speeds are not large enough to show significant signs of the inversion problem. When
the panic mode is turned off and the nodes are allowed to have more than one parent, the algorithm discovers nearly
all stable links. This is because most nodes are reachable through stable links along the mesh for all simulated speeds.
When there is just one parent, even a single link breakage close to the coordinator significantly decreases the number
of links discovered. When nodes have more than one parent alternate paths to the coordinator are ensured, and the
mesh is hence more robust.
When the panic mode is turned on, all the stable links are discovered using a resiliency factor of one, even at high
speeds. The inversion problem becomes visible for

at speeds of 1.8 m/s and above. When

The message overhead of the Gathering phase is shown in Figure 11. When the panic mode is turned off, the
algorithm sends a message along all the links in the mesh. The number of GathResp messages sent is therefore
equal to the number of links in the mesh, and thus proportional to the average number of parents. The slight variations
in the number of messages are due to different mesh structures at different speeds.
When the panic mode is switched on, the number of GathResp messages sent is proportional to the resiliency
factor, except in the case when

Ù&'ò+ .

This behavior can be explained using the graphs in Figure 10. Nearly all

the stable links are discovered when more than one parent is allowed and so very few nodes enter the panic mode.
Therefore most of the traffic flows along the mesh. However, when

Ù'ñ+ , the number of stable links discovered drops

significantly at higher speeds. This is because the mesh is much more fragile with only one parent and so it suffers a
number of link breakages. To still be able to discover 100% of the stable links, a large number of nodes have to enter
the panic mode. When

ÙJ'6+ , the number of GathResp messages sent therefore increases greatly with an increase

in speed.

Figure 12 shows the percentage of stable links discovered when the transmission power is -4 dBm. In this case the
average neighborhood of each node is about 17 and so the algorithm performs quite well even when the panic mode
is turned off. Nearly all the stable links are discovered when more than one parent is allowed. When

is quite fragile and vulnerable to link breakages. The performance of the algorithm is however much better than in the
-6 dBm case shown in Figure 10. With the panic mode turned on, the algorithm discovers all the stable links when

Figure 13. Number of GathResp messages sent for -4 dBm transmission power, and different
values of the resiliency factor .

Ù

The number of GathResp messages sent during the protocol execution is shown in Figure 13. When panic is
turned off, the number of GathResp messages is equal to the number of links in the mesh since there is exactly one
message per link in the Gathering phase. With the panic mode turned on, the message overhead shows a trend similar
to Figure 11 (notice the different scale on the y-axis). The message complexity increases with increasing speeds when
the number of parents allowed is greater than 1. The reason is that an increase in the number of parents gives rise to
alternate paths along the mesh at high speeds. However, when there is just one parent, a number of links in the mesh
break, causing a large number of nodes to enter the panic mode. In the case of a transmission power of -4 dBm, the
effect is however less severe than in the case of -6 dBm, since each node has more reachable neighbors.
All nodes are discovered in all cases except for at the highest speed, when the panic mode is turned off and only
one parent is allowed. In this case 49 out of the 50 nodes were discovered.

7. Related Work
The problem of topology discovery has been extensively studied for the Internet. Commercial systems, such as
HP’s OpenView [1] and IBM’s Tivoli [2], automatically generate the network-layer topology using standard routing
information. Furthermore, in [5], the authors present a scheme using SNMP MIB (Management Information Base)
information to discover physical topology in multi-vendor IP networks, and an algorithm to determine network-layer
topology independent of SNMP is proposed in [13]. In ad hoc networks however, this problem has been largely
overlooked.
The problem of topology discovery in ad hoc networks is significantly different than in wired networks. There
is no IP subnet hierarchy and nodes might have stale neighborhood information. Additionally, there is no popular
network management protocol, such as SNMP, for ad hoc networks. Low overhead, on-demand routing protocols,
such as AODV[11] and DSR[10], also do not store enough state to provide complete topology information. On the
other hand, link state protocols, such as TBRPF[4] and OLSR[9], require each node to constantly maintain a partial
topology of the network. This is an overhead when the link information is required temporarily at a few nodes. Link

state routing protocols also provide only network layer topology information and might not be able to discover the
complete physical connectivity of the network. The mobility of nodes results in communication paths that are prone
to frequent link breakages. These conditions make the problem of topology discovery extremely challenging in ad hoc
networks.
There has however been some work related to topology discovery for ad hoc networks. In [6], the authors provide
a clustering scheme for ad hoc network management. The protocol, called ANMP, uses a distributed set of nodes or
cluster heads to maintain node information. ANMP attempts to incorporate features of SNMP, and uses a hierarchical
scheme to gather topology information. The cluster heads are dynamically chosen based on geographic location or
network connectivity. ANMP uses the MIBs at cluster heads to gather topology information. However, this scheme
has the overhead of constantly maintaining cluster heads in the network. Additionally, the information in the MIBs
might be stale due to mobility and could fail to provide a complete link information of the network.
In [8], a Uniform Quorum Scheme for mobility management in ad hoc networks is proposed. The idea is to
dynamically maintain the node location databases among the network nodes. These nodes are self organizing and are
connected through a virtual backbone. However, this protocol is designed for location and mobility management. It
does not provide the complete physical layer connectivity of the network.
Another topology discovery algorithm is presented in [12]. Mobile agents in the nodes periodically gather topology
information and disseminate it to all the other nodes in the network. However, this scheme does not provide an
instantaneous topology of the network. This algorithm is also extremely intensive in time and messages to discover a
complete topology of the network.
It should however be mentioned that none of the the above protocols were designed to solve the particular problem
of topology discovery we discuss in this paper. All the above approaches look at different variants of topology discovery as they do not aim to discover all the links in the network. The topology information is moved among nodes
in the network depending on the connectivity and traffic in areas of the network. In this paper we look at a different
problem where the entire topology information has to be learned at a few pre-specified nodes. Previous approaches
described above do not provide an efficient infrastructure to solve this problem.
[7] attempts to solve our problem of topology discovery. It provides a protocol, called TopDisc, to discover topology
in sensor networks. A hierarchical tree-based clustering scheme is used to gather neighborhood information from all
the sensor nodes. However, this protocol provides only a partial link information of the network. It also assumes
a reliable broadcast mechanism, which has not yet been developed for ad hoc networks. The tree structure used by
TopDisc is also unstable and susceptible to link breakages because of mobility in the network.

8. Conclusion
In this paper we have defined a precise system model and problem statement for the topology discovery problem.
We have also presented a reliable protocol for topology discovery in wireless networks. The protocol consists of
two phases; the first phase diffuses the initial topology request message across the whole network and the second
propagates the neighborhood information back to the initiating node. The second phase propagates the information
using a mesh structure built during the first phase. This mesh can be used for any kind of data gathering application,
